         <h3 class=" padding text-center">Match Report - October 18th Chesterton</h3>
         <div class="container-fluid">
            <h5>An intriguing fixture was instore when new team to the league Chesterton visited Marsh Drive on a perfect day for football. Pitch was in excellent condition despite all the rain. Both sides had made excellent starts to the campaign each winning all 3 of their respective league games.<br><br> 

Once again player availability was excellent with Mike, Rob D and Tom having to sit this one out.<br><br>

Neal remained in goal covering for the injured celtic supporting rounders fanatic, with Wells returning to a back 3 with Culley and Luka. Charlie and Olive were the wing backs with Smithy, Dom and Farmer the midfield 3. Garrard returned to partner Thommo up top. Liam, Krater, Scott and Baron were on the bench.<br><br>

After a very underwelming performance last week against Wollaston, Linford knew they had to up their game against Chesterton who arrived early and looked a physically imposing side. Chesterton had the better of the opening skirmishes registering the first shot which went high and wide past the right hand post. That was about as good as it got for them as Linford took control of the game after ten minutes or so, flying into challenges putting all the Chesterton players under pressure. Linford took the lead when Farmer robbed the ball in the final third and got it to Garrard he advanced into the box and from a tight angle slammed the ball low and hard past the keeper. More pressure led to a momentous occasion as Charlie scored his first goal for Linford.... ever! With Thommo and Garrard on the press the ball ran loose just inside the box and Charlie just wanted the ball more despite the impending collision and he swung a left leg connected well just ahead of the defender past the stranded keeper.<br><br>

Chesterton on the attack couldn't break down a well organised Linford defence despite getting into decent wide positions and putting some good crosses it was easy pickings for the height of the Linford trio at the back.<br><br>

Garrard who was having a great game was getting loads of attention from various Chesterton players who after one tackle too many asked if the defender wanted a relationship!. That was where the jokes finished as shortly after he went off with a nasty ankle injury. Having been put through one on one with the keeper he took an age to make up his mind whether to shoot or go round him and in doing so allowed the defender enough time to catch him and plough through the back of him. Penalty and a yellow card followed with Luka to most people's surprise stepping up to take the spot kick. He duly sent the keeper the wrong way. Linford rounded off the best 45 minutes of the season with a fourth goal when a corner to the back post was met by Wells which was well saved initially by the keeper but he could only parry it out to Thommo who mopped up the rebound.<br><br>

Krater, Baron and Scott came on for the second half, with Scott still in a mood from seeing Celtic lose was obviously mistaking Chesterton players in their blue kit for Rangers players doing his best to wind them up leading to a bit of handbags. With the ball though Scott set up Thommo for a fifth goal playing him through, thankfully no one told Thommo he had time and he slotted home through the keepers legs.<br><br> 

Farmer and Thommo both went off which meant a makeshift forward line for the last 15 minutes of Luka and Scott which I am pretty sure has never been a sentence written by anyone.<br><br>

A superb result for Linford, five goals and another clean sheet. Linford now second in the table behind the free scoring Wellingborough Saxons on goal difference. Injuries the main worry for next week's game at home to Clean Slate, with Garrard, Farmer, Liam, Tracey, Dom either out or major doubts.<br><br>

         <h3 class=" padding text-center">Match Report - September 27th Northstar</h3>
         <div class="container-fluid">
            <h5>Buoyed by last week's impressive away win against Cranfield, Linford welcomed a new team to the Milton Keynes vets league in Northstar. <br><br>

Luke and Thommo had selection problems as despite a couple of players missing though injury still had more players than what they knew what to do with. Krater, Smithy and Liam volunteered to take a week off. <br><br>

Starting 11 in a 3-5-2 as Neal, Rob D, Culley, Wells, Scott, Sico, Dom, Del, Tracey, Farmer and Thommo. Charlie, Luke, Garrard, and Tom were on the bench.<br><br>

No conclusion could be drawn from Northstar's opening day defeat as they played another new team so with a call to treat them like world beaters, Linford came out of the traps pretty well and could easily have been 4-0 up inside the first twenty minutes. Northstar played quite a high line and were caught 3 times in one on one situations with Dom first of all blazing over, Thommo then shot wide despite having Farmer up with him unmarked. Thommo then from the right hand side fluffed his lines again when he had all the time in the world. Wells then capped off a miserable run of missed chances when his header from a corner hit the post when it seemed easier to score. <br><br>

You give teams a lifeline they invariably take it and Northstar began to get a grip on the game and dominated possession for the rest of the half,  winning all the 50/50 challenges and being first to the second ball. After 35 minutes they exposed space down the Linford left, the Northstar man got one on one with Neal, despite Neal making it difficult the Northstar player was able to get round him and get his bearings to swivel and put the ball past the man on the line for 1-0. <br><br>

Half -time 1-0<br><br>

Luke was ticking inside I'm sure as the Linford players trudged off the pitch not sure how they were losing but he kept his cool as he went about trying to put a plan together to turn things round. Dom and Del were subbed back on for Scott and Tracey and within two minutes Garrard who had been a man possessed since he came on after half an hour weaved his magic down the left side before shooting, the keeper made a smart save but the rebound fell to Dom who couldn't miss the rebound. Thommo made it 2-1 shortly after with a header that was adjusted to be over the line. Linford continued to press and the Northstar keeper was having a very impressive game with a series of fine stops but his and Northstar's chance of getting something out of the game disappeared as Linford scored 3 more in a ten minute spell. Del made it 3-1 tapping home a rebound after Dom inexplicably managed to hit both posts. MOM Garrard leathered a penalty home after Dom had gone down in installments after two fouls on him by Northstar defender. Thommo then tapped home a goal bound header from Rob D to wrap things up. <br><br>

Northstar to there credit kept going and gave Linford a few nervy moments  winning a series of corners but Neal in truth didn't have a shot in anger to save in the second half. So in the end it was fitness and I think experience of Linford which endured in the end. Northstar though I don't think will be winless for very long based on that performance. <br><br>

So two wins from two matches in the league next week Clean Slate at home in the cup.<br><br>

         <h3 class=" padding text-center">Match Report - September 12th Cranfield Away</h3>
         <div class="container-fluid">
            <h5>Great Linford having had a good preseason with 4 wins out of 5 games travelled to Cranfield for the first game of the season with a depleted squad missing Smithy, Giggsy, Olive, Liam, Eamonn, and Garrard.<br><br>
               The MK vets league version of the Cowley brothers Luke and Thommo decide to go with a 3-5-2 formation with stand in keeper Neal in goal, Culley, Wells, and Dickinson at the back. Charlie and Del at wing backs, Scotty holding midfield with Dom and Sico in the centre. Thommo and Farmer lead the line up top. Krater, Baron and Tracey were on the bench.<br><br>
               Cranfield were the only team to take points off of Linford last season in a 2-2 draw so a tough game was expected, and it was Cranfield who had the games first chance in the opening minutes. Soon after though Linford started to get a grip on the game moving the ball through the thirds. Linford took the lead after 15 minutes Del bursting down the left got passed the full back and to the by line and fizzed a low cross into the 6 yard box where a Cranfield defender could only turn it into his own net. Cranfield were almost on level terms after they applied pressure and a shot from the outside of the box hit Dickinson and wrong footing Neal in goal. It looked nailed on to go in but somehow Neal got back to make an excellent save.<br><br>
               Linford went on to take control of the game from then on with two more goals before half time. The first of which was a well struck low free kick by Culley into the bottom left corner of the goal after Thommo had been fouled at the edge of the box. Dom then made it 3-0 after more good work by Thommo let him with all the time in the world to put the ball past the keeper.<br><br>
               In the second half it didn't take Linford long to go further ahead and it was that man Culley again who won a tackle inside his own half, released the ball down the left before continuing his run up the pitch. The ball eventually getting to Dom inside the box and he very unselfishly squared it to the unmarked Culley to score. Cranfield always had a threat going forward with the no 7 proving a handful with the Linford defence often being penalised for fouls upon him. It was from one of those free kicks that Cranfield thought they had pulled a goal back when the centre back turned in a great cross past Neal but he was ruled offside.<br><br>
               As the game drew to a close tempers began to flare as a series of fouls resulted in a handbag moment when Sico somehow getting a foul awarded his way when the whole ground thought it should have gone the other way. Dom goaded by the Cranfield keeper to shoot from over 30 yards from that free kick was the comedy moment of the game. Dom didn't disappoint blazing the ball well over the bar.<br><br>
               Final result 4-0 game won in the first half. Management will be pleased with the performance and the communication in that half in particular.<br>
